Here's a more human-sounding `README.md`.

It's more conversational, explains *why* you built it, and uses emojis to make it more engaging for your hackathon judges.

# ‚ö° Transformer Failure Prediction Dashboard

This is our project for the **HACKATON**\! üöÄ

We built this app to predict the likelihood of transformer failure using a machine learning model. Instead of just a script, we built an interactive dashboard that anyone on our team (or a client) can use.

It can check transformers one by one, or analyze an entire dataset at once.

## üî¥ Live Demo

You can (and should\!) check out the live, running application here:

**[https://your-app-name.streamlit.app](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://your-app-name.streamlit.app)**

*(Just replace that with your actual Streamlit link once it's deployed\!)*

## ‚ú® What's Inside?

We built two main tools into one app:

### 1\. Single Prediction

Got one transformer you're worried about? Go to the "Single Prediction" tab, fill out the form with its stats, and get an instant "Failure Likely" or "No Failure Detected" prediction.

### 2\. Batch Upload & Analyze

This is the powerful part.

  * **Upload Your CSV:** Got a huge file with data (like our `Dataset_Year_2020_Iworkdone2.csv`)? Just upload it.
  * **Automatic Cleaning:** The app automatically cleans the messy data (it turns text like "STRATUM 2" into `0` and fills in missing values), just like our model was trained to handle.
  * **Full Dashboard:** Once it runs the predictions, you get a full dashboard showing:
      * **At-a-Glance Metrics:** Big, bold numbers showing exactly how many transformers are at-risk vs. healthy.
      * **Pie Chart:** A simple, colorful chart showing the % breakdown of healthy vs. failing units.
      * **Full Data Table:** Scroll through your entire uploaded file, now with new columns for the prediction and failure probability.
      * **Download Button:** Click one button to download this new, enriched CSV file to share.

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Under the Hood? (Our Tech Stack)

  * **`üêç Python`**: The core language.
  * **`üéà Streamlit`**: For building the entire interactive web app and dashboard.
  * **`üß† Scikit-learn`**: For the `RandomForestClassifier` model.
  * **`üêº Pandas`**: For all the data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
  * **`üìä Plotly Express`**: For that nice-looking pie chart.

## üíª How to Run This on Your Own Machine

Want to tinker with the code? No problem.

**1. Clone this repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
```

**2. Install the libraries:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Run the app:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your browser should pop open automatically. That's it\!
